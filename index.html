	<p>Ducky likes to go quack when he hears his name. He likes to swim in the pond and waddle round in puddles when its raining. Ducky doesn't like other birds in the water that aren't ducks because the seaguls are greedy and the swans are too scary. QUACK.</p>

	<p id="firstspaceduck">Ducky wants to become the first space duck. Ever since he saw the stars when he was little he has wanted to explore beyond the world he knew. QUACK!</p>
