         <p>Ducky likes to go quack when he hears his name. He likes to swim in the pond and waddle round in puddles when its raining. Ducky doesn't like other birds in the water that aren't ducks because the seaguls are greedy and the swans are too scary. QUACK.</p>

<p>Ducky has a lot of siblings who look exatly like him, but the difference betwen him and the rest is that he is fluffier and likes to wonder around at the back of the line they form behind his mama duck, QUACK.</p>
